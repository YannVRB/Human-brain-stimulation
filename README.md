# Human-brain-stimulation

This repository describes the bulk RNA-seq and multiomic (snRNA-seq + snATAC-seq) analyses performed from our human brain stimulation data.

## Abstract

Activity-induced gene expression underlies synaptic plasticity and brain function. Here, using molecular sequencing techniques, we define activity-dependent transcriptomic and epigenomic changes at the single-cell level in the human brain following direct electrical stimulation of the anterior temporal lobe in patients undergoing neurosurgery. Genes related to DNA-binding transcription factor activity and microglia-specific cytokine activity displayed the greatest induction pattern, revealing a precise cell-type specific molecular signature of neuronal activation in the human brain.

Attached are two markdown files (R language), one describes the bulk RNA-seq analysis after generating the raw count matrix from the bcbio RNA-seq pipeline, the other one describes the downstream multiomic analyses using Cell Ranger Arc outputs.
