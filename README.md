# Human-brain-stimulation

This repository describes the bulk RNA-seq and multiomic (snRNA-seq + snATAC-seq) analyses performed from our human brain stimulation data.

## Abstract

Fundamental studies in rodent models have demonstrated the role of activity-induced gene expression in synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. Recent advancements in molecular techniques to study transcriptomics have enabled our ability to study such neuronal activity-driven gene expression at a very high resolution. However, such studies in living human brains have been extremely limited. Here, we investigated the transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures of electrical stimulation within the anterior temporal lobe of patients treated for epilepsy, thus providing a cell-type specific molecular signature. This molecular signature is conserved from humans to mice. These novel findings reveal a unique molecular signature of electrical in the human brain and advance our understanding of transcriptional dynamics of the human brain.

Attached are two markdown files (R language), one describes the bulk RNA-seq analysis after generating the raw count matrix from the bcbio RNA-seq pipeline, the other one describes the multiomic analysis.
